    <h6>Born a crime</h6>
    <p> <b><em>"He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in cage "</em></b></p>
    <p>This quote from Born a crime brings it out well how some men view women . In the story Abel loved Patricia because of her characters. She was strong, full of life and independent. She often spoke her mind . This is evident  in the apartheid regime.Things changed after Abel married Patricia. She wanted to control her but Patricia refused to give in to Abels thoughts.This made her relationship to be abusive and difficult after sometime.

    </p>
    <p>
        In today’s life men admire women who have made it in life .But after marrying them things turn around .Most of the time they tend not to want women to be independent cause that's the only way they can cage them .They are expected to give up dreams,stay silent about abuse and infidelity in the name of protecting their marriages ,they are robbed freedom of choice and discouraged from working or handover all their salaries to the "husband “.We also see this in work places where they are paid less ,judged for success amongst others . This makes life unfair to them.

      <em>"My mom was a force of nature a woman who would never be kept down "</em> Patricia  refused to be caged she continued going to church ,making her own decision raising trevor her way.This made abel so violent and abusive to the extend of Him shooting her in the head when she tried to leave.
       Miraculoursly she survied when the bullet misssed her vital organs.This made her make a bold decision of divorcing him to protect herself and her baby Trevoh.
    </p>
  <p>In today's world women seem to be standing tall ,but behind the mirrors they are trapped by silent rules.At home they are expected to be quite and obidient ,work places where they are paid less ,judged for sucess amongst others .
    this makes life unfair to them.
</p>  
  <p> Love should be partnership not ownership .True Love supports growth allowing someone to become the best version of thereselves and both voices should be heard in terms of decision and thats what will call Fair love.
    Women should be free spirit and refuse to be tamed.
