    <h2> "He wanted a traditional wife so that he could cage her."Trevor Noah</h2>
        <p>One of the most haunting yet powerful lines in Born a Crime is when Trevor Noah writes that Abel “wanted a traditional wife so
             that he could cage her.”This quote struck me deeply because it reveals how tradition, when twisted, can become a tool for control
             and manipulation rather than culture.Abel and other men in particular approach marriages in search for dominance in the name of love.
             In their minds, a traditional woman is a wife who is willing to obey and submit without questioning the being said or providing any 
             opinions, stay silent, and sacrifice herself to uphold his authority. But Trevor’s mother, Patricia, was far away from that woman. She
             was strong, independent, and outspoken. She believed in living her life with faith, not fear. The issue now is that men really know they
             want a subservient woman who they can dominate but cannot settle for that woman, they want a self made woman so that they can make her small
             to feed their ego and pride because they can destruct whatever a woman constructed. This quote exposes a mindset that still exists in many 
             societies: the idea that women should be submissive, that their strength must be tamed,that women cannot speak for themselves and that culture
             justifies enslavement. Abel wasn’t seeking tradition for the sake of values he was seeking power through control. What I love about Patricia is
             that she didn’t let herself be caged and mimic her identity to the one that society expects her to be. Even when facing violence, she fought back,
             not just for herself but for her son. Her bravery teaches us that tradition should never be used as a weapon to fight us, and love should never feel
             like a prison. Love is meant to be felt and culture/tradition to be celebrated and never to destroy and darken our lives. If it doesn't feel right then 
             it isn't. Reading this part of the book reminded me that we must question the norms we accept. Are they truly about respect and harmony, or are they designed
              to limit others? Trevor’s story makes us reflect, not only on the past, but on the kind of future we want to build—one where strength in women is celebrated,
               not silenced. Born a Crime is more than Trevor’s story it’s a reminder of the battles many still fight every day.</p>
