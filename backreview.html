        <p>Original title: Born a Crime</p>
        <p>Author: Trevor Noah</p>
        <p>‘Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife…but he never fell in love with subservient women…’ <br>He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.’</p>
        <p> Patricia greatly challenged the traditional gender roles that dictated what women should and should not do.<br> She raised her son independently for the better part of his life. The story highlights the strength and resilience <br> of South African women, especially Trevor's mother, who defied traditional expectations by providing for her <br> family despite facing adversity from all aspects of life.

            Most modern men love independent women because of  the packs they come with. They love the feel of <br> not having to provide everything in the house themselves, having someone to depend on whenever <br> things are not working for them, and sharing bills equally. Despite  women also working the same hours <br> as their men, they’re still expected to arrive home early, take care of all household chores, look after the <br> children, and still share the bills, while men sit around after work and expect their women to serve them. 
            <br>
            This is so relatable to Patricia’s own experience, where she worked so hard every  day to provide for her <br> children despite society trying to push her down. She never let Abel’s desire for control  and power win. <br> She still supportetd him in his garage business while still providing for her family, but  Abel still craved <br> control over her life. He wanted to dictate where and when she goes, and even Trevor’s relationship <br> with his father.
            <br>
            When it comes to relationships, most men find themselves in love with independent women until <br> they get married. They start feeling the urge to be superior in the name of being ‘head of the family’. This is very <br> absurd considering they knew exactly who they were falling in love with, but still have the masculine urge to <br> be powerful. They mostly feel threatened whenever they see their women thriving more than them, and that's <br> when violence comes in most of the time, just for them to feel more powerful, in control, and whole.
