        <p>Original title: Born a Crime</p>
        <p>Author: Trevor Noah</p>
        <div class="tradition">
            <p id="marriage">‘Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife…but he never fell in love with
                subservient women…’  He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.’</p>

            <!-- <img src="Images/Family_Photo.webp" id="family"> -->
            <p> Patricia greatly challenged the traditional gender roles that dictated what women should and should not
                do. She raised her son independently for the better part of his life. The story highlights the
                strength and resilience  of South African women, especially Trevor's mother, who defied traditional
                expectations by providing for her  family despite facing adversity from all aspects of life.

        <div class="independence">
            Most modern men love independent women because of the packs they come with. They love the feel of  not
            having to provide everything in the house themselves, having someone to depend on whenever  things are
            not working for them, and sharing bills equally. Despite women also working the same hours  as their
            men, they’re still expected to arrive home early, take care of all household chores, look after the 
            children, and still share the bills, while men sit around after work and expect their women to serve them.

        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="experience">
            This is so relatable to Patricia’s own experience, where she worked so hard every day to provide for her
             children despite society trying to push her down. She never let Abel’s desire for control and power
            win. She still supportetd him in his garage business while still providing for her family, but Abel
            still craved  control over her life. He wanted to dictate where and when she goes, and even Trevor’s
            relationship  with his father.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="relationships">
            When it comes to relationships, most men find themselves in love with independent women until  they get
            married. They start feeling the urge to be superior in the name of being ‘head of the family’. This is very
             absurd considering they knew exactly who they were falling in love with, but still have the masculine
            urge to  be powerful. They mostly feel threatened whenever they see their women thriving more than them,
            and that's  when violence comes in most of the time, just for them to feel more powerful, in control,
            and whole.
