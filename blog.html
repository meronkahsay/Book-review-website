        <h1>Independence</h1>
        <p>“My mom did what school didn't. She taught me how to think.”</p>
        <p>Trevor was raised by his mom as if there were no limitations on where he could go or what he could do.<br>
            She taught him to speak up  and stand up for himself by leading the life he believed in and not what<br> 
            is dictated by society.  His mom taught him to claim his rights despite the situation and that his ideas,<br>
            thoughts and decisions mattered.<br>

            In African homes most firstborns learn the art of independence without them realizing it. Their parents<br>
            impose upon them responsibilities and tasks which teach them to be independent as they have to maneuver<br>
            and figure out things for themselves, though they get the support and guidance indirectly from their parents.<br>

            <h1>Rich without money</h1>
            <p>“As modestly as we lived at home, I never felt poor because our lives were so rich with experience.”<br>
                “Why teach a black child white things? 'Why do this? Why show him the world when he's never going to leave the ghetto?' <br>
                'Even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I've done enough.”
                </p>
            <p> Trevor's life was full of exploration as his mother refused to be bound by the rules that stated what black people couldn't<br> 
                or shouldn't do. Patricia would always find places where she didn't have to spend money. She would take him to the ice rink<br>
                 to go skating, to the drive-in movie theater, and taught him to drive around the white neighbourhood, which was always restricted.<br>


                Parents greatly influence and shape the reality that their children exist in.  Unknowingly,  the decisions made by our parents,<br>
                 like sending us to good schools gave us a chance to experience and explore most of the things we wouldn't have experienced if <br>
                 not in those good schools, like going on school trips, participating in different clubs, e.g Presidential Awards Club, where <br>
                 we got to visit the Statehouse,  STEM projects, and contests. These experiences filled our lives with so many adventures that<br>
                  made us forget our financial situations.

                <h1>Power of language</h1>
                <p>“Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared language says, "We're the same."<br>
                     A language barrier says, "We're different.
                    </p>
                <p>Trevor was always treated differently because of his color. He discovered the greatest method to overcome<br>
                     his racial discrimination was through language, which defines who you are to people more than race.<br>

                    Speaking someone else's language even basic phrases, shows that you understand their culture and identity<br>
                     that is beyond you. When you visit a new place and you're familiar with their language, it creates a certain<br>
                      bond and rapport, which makes it easy to communicate and understand each other.

                         I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.”</p>
                    <p>Trevor's relationship with his mom was full of mutual respect and understanding.Growing up, Trevor did<br>
                         not understand the tough relationship with his mother, but growing older, he started understanding that<br>
                          his mother was beating him “out of love” before the system did.<br>
                        As kids, being beaten by our parents was a daily norm. At the time, we thought it was out of hate, even<br>
                         though they kept saying they were disciplining us out of love and to make us better people in society.

                        <h1>Patriachy</h1>
                        <p>“We are talking about a world where women must bow when they greet a man. Men and women have limited social<br>
                             interactions. Men are not even allowed in the kitchen.”</p>
                        <p>Abel wanted a traditional wife who would obey him unquestioningly. His culture was extremely patriarchal <br>
                             in that men would work in the city the whole year to support their family, while women stayed back to do<br>
                              a multitude of house chores. During holidays  when the men came back from the city they would only do <br>
                              whatever manly tasks needed to be done, but then they would go to hang out and drink as men, while women<br>
                               stayed at home to cook and clean.<br>

                            In our African homes, boys and men never do the daily house chores such as cleaning, cooking, washing, or<br>
                             taking care of their siblings. They usually just sit around, holding barazas with fellow men, spending <br>
                             time in the bars and clubs, having fun, and waiting for women to take care of them.
