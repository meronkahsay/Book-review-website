                The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg  book  explains how habits shape our lives. The book shows that habits are not just personal — they affect companies and even whole communities.
                Duhigg explains that every habit works in a loop: cue, routine, and reward. One of the main examples he gives is of Eugene Pauly, a man who lost part of his brain and couldn’t remember new things. However, he could still take daily walks and find snacks in his kitchen. This showed that habits form in a different part of the brain and don’t need memory once they are strong.
                Another powerful story is about Lisa Allen, a woman who used to smoke, overeat, and be in debt. After she decided to quit smoking, she changed other habits too. She started running, eating healthy, and even saving money. Duhigg calls this a “keystone habit.” When you change one important habit, others can follow.
                In the business world, the book explains how Febreze almost failed until marketers realized people needed a reward for a fresh-smelling home  to build the habit of using it after cleaning. Once the company made Febreze part of a cleaning routine, it became a best-seller.
                Charles Duhigg  also talks about Starbucks, where employees are trained to deal with angry customers by practicing routines. Instead of reacting badly, they use positive habits to stay calm and helpful in responding to anger.
                Lastly, Duhigg explains how Martin Luther King Jr. and civil rights leaders used social habits to bring people together. People joined protests and marches not only for justice, but because friends and neighbors were doing it too. This helped the movement grow stronger.
                In conclusion, The Power of Habit teaches that we are not stuck with bad routines. By understanding how habits work, we can take control and change our lives.
