            <h2>Why Outlawed By Birth</h2>

            <p>I chose to rename the Born A Crime title to Outlawed By Birth since its meaning is the same which
                highligths
                the idea
                of being seen as illegal from the very start of life. Trevor Noah,the writer of the book,experiences
                this as a consequence of his parents' mistakes.

            <q>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with
                subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.</q>
            <p>This quote brings an insightful discussion about relationship expectations and gender roles which is
                common in today's society</p>
            <p>Abel's desire for power brings about societal expectations in many cultures where women are expected
                to be subservient, perform domestic duties and follow their husband's lead</p>
            <p>We see that Patricia , Trevor's mother, when she got married to Abel things started taking a drastic
                change</p>
            <p>Abel's presence in the house brought with it new rules. Patricia was not allowed to do whatever she
                wanted or go wherever she wanted. He even got upset about church."You cannot be at church the whole
                day ," he'd say.</p>
            <p>"My wife is gone all day, and what will people say?"Why is his wife not around?Where is she?This is
                the expectation that the culture wants from a woman, being primarily responsible for house chores.
            </p>
            <p>However,Abel's desire to fall in love with a submissive woman but never actually falling in love with
                subservient women. Him wanting to "put her in a cage" reveals the theme of patriachal mindset. How
                is it possible to have an independent woman and confine her with traditional roles and control her?
                This seemed impossible yet to Abel it seemed possible.</p>
            <p>In today's society, men desire independent women for their own selfish reasons , which include making
                them take a major role in household management and share responsibilities. </p>

            <p>In today's society , there are some traditional societal expectations where women are expected to
                prioritize their family and domestic responsibilities over their careers. Marital laws state that
                women are supposed to marry and have children and still expected to take part in some leadership
                roles
                but just to a certain extent. </p>
            <p>In conclusion gender roles and expectations still exist in today's society.My question is, Is it
                possible to foster an environment where women can thrive without the pressure of societal
                expectations?.</p>
