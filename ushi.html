            <h1>Outlawed By Birth</h1>
            <p>I chose to rename Born A Crime title to Outlawed By Birth since its meaning are the same which higligths the idea 
                of being seen as illegal from the very start of life. Trevor Noah the writter of the book experiences this as a consequence of his parents mistakes.

               <q>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.</q> 
               <p>This quote brings an insightful discusssion about relationship expectations and gender roles which is common in today's society</p>
               <p>Abel's desire for power brings about societal expectations in many cultures where women are expected to be subservient, perform domestic duties and follow their husband's lead</p>
               <p>We see that Patricia , Trevor's mother, when she got married to Abel things started taking a drastic  change</p>
               <p>Abel's presense in the house brought with it new rules. Patricia was not allowed to do  whatever she wanted or go wherever she wanted. He even got upset about church."You cannot be at church the whole day ," he'd say.</p>
               <p>"My wife is gone all day, and what will people say?'Why is his wife not around?Where is she?This is the expectation that the culture wants from a woman, being primarily responsible for house chores.</p>
               <p>However,Abel's desire to fall in love with a submissive women but never actually falling in love with subservient women. Him wanting to "put her in a cage" reveals the theme of partriachal mindset. How is it possible to have an independent woman and confine her with traditional roles and control her? This seemed impossible yet to Abel it seemed possible.</p>
               <p>In today's society, men desire independent women for their own selfish reasons , which include making them take a major role in household management and share responsibilities. </p>

               <p>In todays society , there are some traditional societal expectations where women are expected to prioritize their family and domestic responsibilities over their careers. Marital laws state that women are supposed to marry and have children and still expected take part in some leadership roles but just to a certain extent. </p>
               <p>In conclusion gender roles and expectations still exists in today's society.My question is, Is it possible to foster an environment where women can thrive without the pressure of societal expectations?.</p>
