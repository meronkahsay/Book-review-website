                    <h1>Independence</h1>
                    <h4>“My mom did what school didn't. She taught me how to think.”</h4>
                    <p>Trevor was raised by his mom as if there were no limitations on where he could go or what he
                        could do.<br>
                        She taught him to speak up and stand up for himself by leading the life he believed in and not
                        what<br>
                        is dictated by society. His mom taught him to claim his rights despite the situation and that
                        his ideas,<br>
                        thoughts and decisions mattered.<br>

                        In African homes most firstborns learn the art of independence without them realizing it. Their
                        parents<br>
                        impose upon them responsibilities and tasks which teach them to be independent as they have to
                        maneuver<br>
                        and figure out things for themselves, though they get the support and guidance indirectly from
                        their parents.<br>

                    <h1>Rich without money</h1>
                    <h4>“As modestly as we lived at home, I never felt poor because our lives were so rich with
                        experience.”<br>
                        “Why teach a black child white things? 'Why do this? Why show him the world when he's never
                        going to leave the ghetto?' <br>
                        'Even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is
                        all I accomplish, I've done enough.”
                    </h4>
                    <p> Trevor's life was full of exploration as his mother refused to be bound by the rules that stated
                        what black people couldn't<br>
                        or shouldn't do. Patricia would always find places where she didn't have to spend money. She
                        would take him to the ice rink<br>
                        to go skating, to the drive-in movie theater, and taught him to drive around the white
                        neighbourhood, which was always restricted.<br>


                        Parents greatly influence and shape the reality that their children exist in. Unknowingly, the
                        decisions made by our parents,<br>
                        like sending us to good schools gave us a chance to experience and explore most of the things we
                        wouldn't have experienced if <br>
                        not in those good schools, like going on school trips, participating in different clubs, e.g
                        Presidential Awards Club, where <br>
                        we got to visit the Statehouse, STEM projects, and contests. These experiences filled our lives
                        with so many adventures that<br>
                        made us forget our financial situations.

                    <h1>Power of language</h1>
                    <h4>“Language brings with it an identity and a culture, or at least the perception of it. A shared
                        language says, "We're the same."<br>
                        A language barrier says, "We're different.
                    </h4>
                    <p>Trevor was always treated differently because of his color. He discovered the greatest method to
                        overcome<br>
                        his racial discrimination was through language, which defines who you are to people more than
                        race.<br>

                        Speaking someone else's language even basic phrases, shows that you understand their culture and
                        identity<br>
                        that is beyond you. When you visit a new place and you're familiar with their language, it
                        creates a certain<br>
                        bond and rapport, which makes it easy to communicate and understand each other.

                    I’m trying to save you. When they beat you, they’re trying to kill you.”</h4>
                <p>Trevor's relationship with his mom was full of mutual respect and understanding.Growing up, Trevor
                    did<br>
                    not understand the tough relationship with his mother, but growing older, he started understanding
                    that<br>
                    his mother was beating him “out of love” before the system did.<br>
                    As kids, being beaten by our parents was a daily norm. At the time, we thought it was out of hate,
                    even<br>
                    though they kept saying they were disciplining us out of love and to make us better people in
                    society.

                <p>“We are talking about a world where women must bow when they greet a man. Men and women have limited
                    social<br>
                    interactions. Men are not even allowed in the kitchen.”</p>
                <p>Abel wanted a traditional wife who would obey him unquestioningly. His culture was extremely
                    patriarchal <br>
                    in that men would work in the city the whole year to support their family, while women stayed back
                    to do<br>
                    a multitude of house chores. During holidays when the men came back from the city they would only do
                    <br>
                    whatever manly tasks needed to be done, but then they would go to hang out and drink as men, while
                    women<br>
                    stayed at home to cook and clean.<br>


                    In our African homes, boys and men never do the daily house chores such as cleaning, cooking,
                    washing,
                    or<br>
                    taking care of their siblings. They usually just sit around, holding barazas with fellow men,
                    spending <br>
                    time in the bars and clubs, having fun, and waiting for women to take care of them.
