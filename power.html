                <h3>Habit loop</h3>
                <p>"As the route became more automatic, each rat started thinking less and less."</p>
                <p>Duhigg explains the formation of habits using a framework of the cue, routine, and reward. <br> The
                    Cue: Anything that initiates a habit. It can be time, location, emotional state, or even <br> a
                    previous action. Just like someone who, whenever they feel angry or stressed, that’s a cue <br>for
                    them to drink alcohol. <br>
                    The Routine: The habit or behavior triggered by the cue. With the above example, drinking <br>
                    alcohol can be a habit. And going for lunch at noon is a routine. A routine is the action that <br>
                    is done automatically with no effort when a cue is identified. <br> The Reward: The outcome or the
                    prize you get after your routine is the reward. For example, <br> if you drink alcohol, then your
                    stress is relieved, or using perfume because you want to feel <br> the smell of fruits or any
                    preferred scent.

                <h3>The Craving Brain and the <br> golden rule of habit change</h3>
                <p>"He created a craving. And that craving , it turns out is what makes cues and rewards work."</p>
                <p>The principle of the craving brain mainly outlines that when something becomes a habit, <br> the
                    brain starts getting used to it to the extent that whenever a cue is identified, the brain <br>
                    anticipates for the reward even before the routine is done, which makes the habit easier <br> to do
                    without giving it thought because the brain is already craving for the reward. An <br> example is
                    when you get to know that today chicken will be served, you’re already <br> feeling the sweetness of
                    eating the chicken before you are even sure that it’s going to <br> be served. When everything
                    becomes usual, the brain already knows what it will look <br> like before you perform the routine.
                    <br> The golden rule of habit change suggests keeping the cue and reward and simply <br> changing
                    the routine, since it creates
                    a habit itself. For example, if you tend to reach <br> for a snack when you feel stressed, you can
                    keep the stress as the cue and the feeling <br> of reward (e.g., relief, satisfaction) as the
                    reward, but substitute a glass of water or <br> a walk for the snacks.

                <h3>Keystone Habits</h3>
                <p>"As Alcoa's safety patterns shifted, other aspects of the company started changing <br> with
                    startling speed as well."</p>
                <p>Keystone habits are habits that not only affect one area of your life but also lay as a <br>
                    cornerstone for other good habits. They influence your overall habits for the better good, <br>
                    leading to significant improvements in various aspects of your life. Such habits include <br>
                    reading, reading is a habit that will open you to various topics and worlds, hence altering <br>
                    your perspective about life, which can change how you approach life. Starting to read as <br> a
                    habit can lead to numerous other habits, like saving, physical activity, how you speak to <br>
                    people, etc, all because you got lost in a book and started applying the dynamics of it.

                <h3>The neurology of free will</h3>
                <p>"If you believe you can change, if you make it a habit, the change becomes real."</p>
                <p>Charles Duhigg explores the neurology of free will, arguing that while habits can be <br> deeply
                    ingrained, they are not destiny and can be changed. He suggests that individuals <br> can control
                    their habits through conscious effort and understanding. Duhigg argues that <br> individuals are
                    morally responsible for their habits because they can, through conscious <br> choice, change them.
                    He emphasizes the concept, suggesting that people have the power <br> to choose how they act, even
                    if habits have a strong influence. Duhigg emphasizes the <br> importance of believing in one's
                    ability to change and make it a habit, as this belief is <br> crucial for achieving lasting change.
                    Duhigg later concludes that habits are not destiny, <br> but rather that individuals have the power
                    to choose their habits and create a <br> desired future. In other words, we constantly choose our
                    habits by what actions we <br> perform and hold the power to change our habits to what we <br> want
                    them to be by believing we can and making the steps towards our desired habits.</p>
